## Jupyter Notebook
Note: During this project, we had created a repo and uploaded several different branches to optimize AlexNet in parallel. For this reason, we compiled our jupyter notebooks together, and leave them in this Zip file. 

## Data
Note: We collected the data from Kaggle, although we did not include the train and test images. For more information about the dataset, you can refer to our collaborative GitHub here: https://github.com/darintsui/cogs181/tree/main
